#### _Super Galactic Age calculater: Solo Epicodus exercise, 10.13.2017_

## Description

_This app will give you your age( in seconds base) base on which planet you are on._

## Specification

* Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds.
* Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)
* Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
* Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
* Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
* Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
* Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy shouldn’’t be a hard-coded value. After all, it can vary from country to country and depending on various demographics.)
* If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
