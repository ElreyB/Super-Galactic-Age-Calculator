# _Super Galactic Age calculater_

#### _Super Galactic Age calculater: Solo Epicodus exercise, 10.13.2017_

## Description

_This app will give you your age(seconds on Earth) base on which planet you are on._

## Future Functionality

* Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. (Note that life expectancy shouldn’t be a hard-coded value. After all, it can vary from country to country and depending on various demographics.)
* If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
